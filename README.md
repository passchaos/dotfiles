dotfiles by luksamuk
====================

Some dotfiles and important system files used on my computer.

Index:
- bashscripts

    Some important or interesting bash scripts used on system level.
    Includes stuff like screen recording, touchpad toggling, internet speed test, etc.
    
- bspwm

    Overall configuration files for bspwm.
    Includes both bspwmrc and sxhkdrc, conky's topbar, etc.
    
- conky

    Some extra, heavily-modified versions of conky made by myself (which I do not take ownership).

- powerline
	
	Some modifications I made to Agnoster theme and vimrc to enable powerline support - mostly related to the usage of phallus' lemon font.
	Tip: lemon font might conflict with Google's Lemon font, so you might need to uninstall it.
